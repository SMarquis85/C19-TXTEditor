  ## Description of Assignment

As you have progressed through this course, you have put together a number of impressive projects that you can show off to potential employers. This project is no exception; in fact, it features some of the most impressive expressions of the concepts you have learned so far.

Your task is to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline.

To build this text editor, you will start with an existing application and implement methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. You will use a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.

You will deploy this full-stack application to Heroku using the Heroku Deployment Guide on The Full-Stack BlogLinks to an external site..

  ## About 

---
### User Story

```
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use
```
### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a text editor web application
WHEN I open my application in my editor
THEN I should see a client server folder structure
WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
WHEN I run my webpack plugins
THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
WHEN I open the text editor
THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
WHEN I click on the Install button
THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
WHEN I load my web application
THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
WHEN I register a service worker
THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
WHEN I deploy to Heroku
THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
```

  ## Final Work Review

**"Always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it."**  This action was applied to ALL JAVASCRIPT files. To create this assignment, I used Lawrence Wilson's Audiobook. References we're found on Google, multiple websites including W3Schools, DEV, GitHub, Insomnia and Tutorialspoint. YouTube was helpful as well as all ZOOM recordings (of previous classes). Looks much cleaner, organised and easier to find what you are looking for. I also received the help of my tutor, Erik Hoversten. Erik and I are currently working on deployment to Heroku.

At this time, there's an error when trying to push my assigment to Heroku. (It only works locally. (http://localhost:3000/))
